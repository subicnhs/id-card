      <p>Dear visitors,</p>
      <p> <span class="space"> space </span> Hi! it's so nice to see you exploring my website! I am a student of an undergoing Strengthened SHS Curriculum on one of the schools in Subic, Zambales Philippines. My name is <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://m.facebook.com/avebayland/">Abraham Bayland</a> and i am the creator and designer of both this website and the ID Cards. I am also the Card Holder No. 000001 which occupies the position of Sergeant & Arms 1 and a 4 year student in Special Program in the Arts (SPA) in the same school. The reason for making this website is i got bored as i was roaming around my bag and my equipments.</p>
      
      <p> <span class="space"> space </span> Months earlier, i bought an NFC ID Tag that only works on Samsung Brands (phone) on Tiktok Shop. This NFC ID Tag is an NXP MIFARE Ultralight C which can be used for event passes, transit tickets, and many more. This card was basically unused for many months and i do not know what to do with this until i came up with this idea alone. I know this idea was currently being used by other schools internationally and locally by private schools. </p>
      
      <p> <span class="space"> space </span> The main target of this idea is for identification of class officers in my classroom and to avoid any violations made by any registered ID Card Holders and officers in this classroom. If they were to violate any rules and regulations made by the school and this ID Card itself, a teacher or a class officer (with higher rank) has the full rights to directly confiscate and take away his/her ID Card and Permission to be an officer for a week or so (depending on the violated rules). If any rules are broken on both sides at the same time (this ID Card and school law/rules), they are automatically be removed from the "Registered Card Holders" and will be restricted for any requests and applications for an ID Card.</p>
      
      <p> <span class="space"> space </span> This "Boredom Project" will be handed to one of my "Drafted" projects since it was technically made from scratch with the help of multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) uncluding <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.meta.ai/">Meta AI</a> and a bit of my known coding skills that i've gained through multiple online courses (including <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> W3Schools</a> if you want free a online course). This website is only a designer's website without any kinds of databases and and online interaction with other users that uses this. I made this website from a free tool from playstore called <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teejay.trebedit">TrebEdit</a>. You can also find other free HTML Editor but i suggest that you have to use an offline app like <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teejay.trebedit">TrebEdit</a> and <a style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.spck">SPCK Editor / Git Client</a>. </p>
